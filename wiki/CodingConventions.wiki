#summary This page describes a list of proposed coding conventions for the whole team.

= Proposed Conventions =

 * The beginning of every statement must be indented by a multiple of 4 spaces (not tabs).
 * If a statement needs to be continued on the next line, it should be indented by exactly one additional space.
 * Every statement should end with a semicolon.
 * There should be no spaces immediately before or after a parenthesis, bracket, or brace.
 * All strings should be in double quotes unless there is a good reason for single quotes.
 * Variable names should be in lowerCamelCase.
 * Class names (if we create any) should be in UpperCamelCase.
 * The `const` keyword *must not* be used. Internet Explorer 10 doesn't support it. Use `var` instead.
